# Code Introduction
WMMSE.m : The main function for the [WMMSE algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5756489/).  
R-WMMSE.m : The main function for the [R-WMMSE algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10054084/).    
find_U1.m : The function for finding the U in each iteration of the WMMSE algorithm.  
find_W1.m : The function for finding the W in each iteration of the WMMSE algorithm.  
find_V1.m : The function for finding the V in each iteration of the WMMSE algorithm.  
sumrate.m : The function for computing the sum rate in the WMMSE algorithm.  
Test_R_WMMSE.m : This is a function used to test R_WMMSE performance, enter the required parameters and the function would return the number of iterations, running time and sum rate information  

find_U.m : The function for finding the U in each iteration of the R-WMMSE algorithm.  
find_W1.m : The function for finding the W in each iteration of the R-WMMSE algorithm.  
find_X.m : The function for finding the X in each iteration of the R-WMMSE algorithm.  
sumrate.m : The function for computing the sum rate in the R-WMMSE algorithm.  
Test_WMMSE.m : This is a function used to test WMMSE performance, enter the required parameters and the function would return the number of iterations, running time and sum rate information  

Test.m : This script is used to access the performance gap between the two algorithms WMMSE and R-WMMSE. The indicators include running time, number of iterations and final sum rate. Currently this script only supports the simulation scenario of a single base station.  
figs : The folder that stores the results in different scenario configurations.  
# Result
Run Test.m in matlab and get the following figures, one for running time and the other for sum rate:
